# **Dr. Seuss Flavored Markov**

Boat could you the very sad, no.<br/>
Seuss the star belly children had none upon thars then,<br/>
He fell on top of the grickle grass,<br/>
For you snooty old nuisance lorax,<br/>
No fear, they all if your way so tall,<br/>
Long time at the trees, with more trees, and great grandfather snail.<br/>
.<br/>
That's how my cough they will bump.<br/>
That's not like to run down pup is ten dollars each day,<br/>
Go there.<br/>
Repeat,<br/>
And some are old nuisance lorax seems perfectly true,<br/>
That is no one has other uses.<br/>
Stranger zipped up chappie packed up came thing two dogs get so,<br/>
They are sneetches are old and the air,<br/>
Wet day i've worried and work to your information, that fool thneed.<br/>
.<br/>
Fame you'll start,<br/>
He spoke with hops and look can get on train could you may.<br/>
What's that be seeing great grandfather snail.<br/>
Would not like them eat them.<br/>
And will not shine.<br/>
You snooty old nuisance lorax, as famous can hold up with fox.<br/>
The plain belly sneetches are low.<br/>

## **A Peek Into How Markov's Work**

<t/>A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. Informally, this may be thought of as, "What happens next depends only on the state of affairs now."<br/>

<t/>Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world processes, such as studying cruise control systems in motor vehicles, queues or lines of customers arriving at an airport, currency exchange rates and animal population dynamics. Markov processes are the basis for general stochastic simulation methods, which are used for simulating sampling from complex probability distributions, and have found application in Bayesian statistics, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, physics, chemistry, economics, finance, signal processing, information theory and speech processing.<br/>
