# **Dr. Seuss Flavored Markov**

Boat could you the very sad, no.<br/>
Seuss the star belly children had none upon thars then,<br/>
He fell on top of the grickle grass,<br/>
For you snooty old nuisance lorax,<br/>
No fear, they all if your way so tall,<br/>
Long time at the trees, with more trees, and great grandfather snail.<br/>
.<br/>
That's how my cough they will bump.<br/>
That's not like to run down pup is ten dollars each day,<br/>
Go there.<br/>
Repeat,<br/>
And some are old nuisance lorax seems perfectly true,<br/>
That is no one has other uses.<br/>
Stranger zipped up chappie packed up came thing two dogs get so,<br/>
They are sneetches are old and the air,<br/>
Wet day i've worried and work to your information, that fool thneed.<br/>
.<br/>
Fame you'll start,<br/>
He spoke with hops and look can get on train could you may.<br/>
What's that be seeing great grandfather snail.<br/>
Would not like them eat them.<br/>
And will not shine.<br/>
You snooty old nuisance lorax, as famous can hold up with fox.<br/>
The plain belly sneetches are low.<br/>
