Oh, the Places You'll Go!
by
Dr. Seuss

Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!

You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself
any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.

You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.
About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,
you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.

And you may not find any
you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
you'll head straight out of town.

It's opener there
in the wide open air.

Out there things can happen
and frequently do
to people as brainy
and footsy as you.

And then things start to happen,
don't worry. Don't stew.
Just go right along.
You'll start happening too.

OH!
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!

You'll be on y our way up!
You'll be seeing great sights!
You'll join the high fliers
who soar to high heights.

You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.
You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.
Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.

Except when you don't.
Because, sometimes, you won't.

I'm sorry to say so
but, sadly, it's true
that Bang-ups
and Hang-ups
can happen to you.

You can get all hung up
in a prickle-ly perch.
And your gang will fly on.
You'll be left in a Lurch.

You'll come down from the Lurch
with an unpleasant bump.
And the chances are, then,
that you'll be in a Slump.

And when you're in a Slump,
you're not in for much fun.
Un-slumping yourself
is not easily done.

You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.
Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're darked.
A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
How much can you lose? How much can you win?

And IF you go in, should you turn left or right...
or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?
Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.

You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace
and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space,
headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.
The Waiting Place...

...for people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go
or a bus to come, or a plane to go
or the mail to come, or the rain to go
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a Yes or No
or waiting for their hair to grow.
Everyone is just waiting.

Waiting for the fish to bite
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for Friday night
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
Everyone is just waiting.

NO!
That's not for you!

Somehow you'll escape
all that waiting and staying
You'll find the bright places
where Boom Bands are playing.

With banner flip-flapping,
once more you'll ride high!
Ready for anything under the sky.
Ready because you're that kind of a guy!

Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.
And the magical things you can do with that ball
will make you the winning-est winner of all.
Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can be,
with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.

Except when they don't
Because, sometimes they won't.

I'm afraid that some times
you'll play lonely games too.
Games you can't win
'cause you'll play against you.

All Alone!
Whether you like it or not,
Alone will be something
you'll be quite a lot.

And when you're alone, there's a very good chance
you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.
There are some, down the road between hither and yon,
that can scare you so much you won't want to go on.

But on you will go
though the weather be foul.
On you will go
though your enemies prowl.
On you will go
though the Hakken-Kraks howl.
Onward up many
a frightening creek,
though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak.

On and on you will hike,
And I know you'll hike far
and face up to your problems
whatever they are.

You'll get mixed up, of course,
as you already know.
You'll get mixed up
with many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
and remember that Life's
a Great Balancing Act.
Just never foget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.

And will you succeed?
Yes! You will, indeed!
(98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)

KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!

So...
be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray
or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea,
You're off the Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting.
So...get on your way!

The Cat in the Hat
Dr Seuss
the sun did not shine.
it was too wet to play.
so we sat in the house
all that cold, cold, wet day.

i sat there with sally.
we sat there, we two.
and i said, 'how i wish
we had something to do!'

too wet to go out
and too cold to play ball.
so we sat in the house.
we did nothing at all.

so all we could do was to
sit!
sit!
sit!
sit!
and we did not like it.
not one little bit.

and then something went BUMP!
how that bump made us jump!
we looked!
then we saw him step in on the mat!
we looked!
and we saw him!
the cat in the hat!
and he said to us,
'why do you sit there like that?'
'i know it is wet
and the sun is not sunny.
but we can have
lots of good fun that is funny!'

'i know some good games we could play,'
said the cat.
'i know some new tricks,'
said the cat in the hat.
'a lot of good tricks.
i will show them to you.
your mother will not mind at all if i do.'

then sally and i
did not know what to say.
our mother was out of the house
for the day.

but our fish said, 'no! no!
make that cat go away!
tell that cat in the hat
you do NOT want to play.
he should not be here.
he should not be about.
he should not be here
when your mother is out!'

'now! now! have no fear.
have no fear!' said the cat.
'my tricks are not bad,'
said the cat in the hat.
'why, we can have
lots of good fun, if you wish,
with a game that i call
up-up-up with a fish!'

'put me down!' said the fish.
'this is no fun at all!
put me down!' said the fish.
'i do NOT wish to fall!'

'have no fear!' said the cat.
'i will not let you fall.
i will hold you up high
as i stand on a ball.
with a book one one hand!
and a cup on my hat!
but that is not ALL i can do!
said the cat...

'look at me!
look at me now!' said the cat.
'with a cup and a cake
on the top of my hat!
i can hold up TWO books!
i can hold up the fish!
and a little toy ship!
and some milk on a dish!
and look!
i can hop up and down on the ball!
but that is not all!
oh, no.
that is not all...

'look at me!
look at me!
look at me NOW!
it is fun to have fun
but you have to know how.
i can hold up the cup
and the milk and the cake!
i can hold up these books!
and the fish on a rake!
i can hold the toy ship
and a little toy man!
and look! with my tail
i can hold a red fan!
i can fan with the fan
as i hop on the ball!
but that is not all.
oh, no.
that is not all...'

that is what the cat said...
then he fell on his head!
he came down with a bump
from up there on the ball.
and sally and i,
we saw ALL the things fall!

and our fish came down, too.
he fell into a pot!
he said, 'do i like this?
oh, no! i do not.
this is not a good game,'
said our fish as he lit.
'no, i do not like it,
not one little bit!'

'now look what you did!'
said the fish to the cat.
'now look at this house!
look at this! look at that!
you sank our toy ship,
sank it deep in the cake.
you shook up our house
and you bent our new rake.
you SHOULD NOT be here
when our mother is not.
you get out of this house!'
said the fish in the pot.

'but i like to be here.
oh, i like it a lot!'
said the cat in the hat
to the fish in the pot.
'i will NOT go away.
i do NOT wish to go!
and so,' said the cat in the hat,
'so
so
so...
i will show you
another good game that i know!'

and then he ran out.
and, then, fast as a fox,
the cat in the hat
came back in with a box.
a big red wood box.
it was shut with a hook.
'now look at this trick,'
said the cat.
'take a look!'

then he got up on top
with a tip of his hat.
'i call this game fun-in-a-box,'
said the cat.
'in this box are two things
i will show to you now.
you will like these two things,'
said the cat with a bow.

'i will pick up the hook.
you will see something new.
two things. and i call them
Thing One and Thing Two.
these Things will not bite you.
they want to have fun.'
then, out of the box
came Thing Two and Thing One!
and they ran to us fast.
they said, 'how do you do?
would you like to shake hands
with Thing One and Thing Two?'

and sally and i
did not know what to do.
so we had to shake hands
with Thing One and Thing Two.
we shook their two hands.
but our fish said, 'no! no!
those Things should not be
in this house! make them go!
they should not be here
when your mother is not!
put them out! put them out!'
said the fish in the pot.

'have no fear, little fish,'
said the cat in the hat.
'these Things are good Things.'
and he gave them a pat.
'they are tame. oh, so tame!
they have come here to play.
they will give you some fun
on this wet, wet, wet day.'

now, here is a game that they like,'
said the cat.
'they like to fly kites,'
said the cat in the hat.

'no! not in the house!'
said the fish in the pot.
'they should not fly kites
in a house! they should not.
oh, the things they will bump!
oh, the things they will hit!
oh, i do not like it!
not one little bit!'

then sally and i
saw them run down the hall.
we saw those two Things
bump their kites on the wall!
bump! thump! thump! bump!
down the wall in the hall.

thing two and thing one!
they ran up! they ran down!
on the string of one kite
we saw mother's new gown!
her gown with the dots
that are pink, white and red.
then we saw one kite bump
on the head of her bed!

then those things ran about
with big bumps, jumps and kicks
and with hops and big thumps
and all kinds of bad tricks.
and i said,
'i do NOT like the way that they play!
if mother could see this,
oh, what would she say!'

then our fish said, 'look! look!'
and our fish shook with fear.
'your mother is on her way home!
do you hear?
oh, what will she do to us?
what will she say?
oh, she will not like it
to find us this way!'

'so DO something! fast!' said the fish.
'do you hear!
i saw her. your mother!
your mother is near!
so, as fast as you can,
think of something to do!
you will have to get rid of
thing one and thing two!'

so, as fast as i could,
i went after my net.
and i said, 'with my net
i can get them i bet.
i bet, with my net,
i can get those things yet!'

then i let down my net.
it came down with a PLOP!
and i had them! at last!
those two things had to stop.
then i said to the cat,
'now you do as i say.
you pack up those Things
and you take them away!'

'oh dear!' said the cat.
'you did not like our game...
oh dear.
what a shame!
what a shame!
what a shame!'

then he shut up the things
in the box with the hook.
and the cat went away
with a sad kind of look.

'that is good,' said the fish.
'he has gone away. yes.
but your mother will come.
she will find this big mess!
and this mess is so big
and so deep and so tall,
we can not pick it up.
there is no way at all!'

and THEN!
who was back in the house?
why, the cat!
'have no fear of this mess,'
said the cat in the hat.
'i always pick up all my playthings
and so...
i will show you another
good trick that i know!'

then we saw him pick up all the things that were down.
he picked up the cake,
and the rake, and the gown,
and the milk, and the strings,
and the books, and the dish,
and the fan, and the cup,
and the ship, and the fish.
and he put them away.
then he said, 'that is that.'
and then he was gone
with a tip of his hat.

then our mother came in
and she said to us two,
'did you have any fun?
tell me. what did you do?'

and sally and i did not know
what to say.
should we tell her
the things that went on there that day?

should we tell her about it?
now, what SHOULD we do?
well...
what would YOU do
if your mother asked YOU?


The Lorax
By Dr. Seuss
UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot,
nothing is going to get better.
It's not.

At the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows and no
birds ever sing excepting old crows... is the Street of the Lifted Lorax.
And deep in the Grickle-grass, some people say, if you look deep enough you can still see, today, where the
Lorax once stood just as long as it could before somebody lifted the Lorax away.
What was the Lorax? Any why was it there? And why was it lifted and taken somewhere from the far end of
town where the Grickle-grass grows? The old Once-ler still lives here.
Ask him, he knows.
You won't see the Once-ler. Don't knock at his door. He stays in his Lerkim on top of his store. He stays in his
Lerkim, cold under the floor, where he makes his own clothes out of miff-muffered moof. And on special dank
midnights in August, he peeks out of the shutters and sometimes he speaks and tells how the Lorax was lifted
away. He'll tell you, perhaps... if you're willing to pay.
On the end of a rope he lets down a tin pail and you have to toss in fifteen cents and a nail and the shell of a
great-great-great- grandfather snail.
Then he pulls up the pail, makes a most careful count to see if you've paid him the proper amount. Then he
hides what you paid him away in his Snuvv, his secret strange hole in his gruvvulous glove. Then he grunts. I
will call you by Whisper-ma-Phone, for the secrets I tell you are for your ears alone.
SLUPP Down slupps the Whisper-ma-Phone to your ear and the old Once-ler's whispers are not very clear,
since they have to come down through a snergelly hose, and he sounds as if he had smallish bees up his nose.
Now I'll tell you, he says, with his teeth sounding gray, how the Lorax got lifted and taken away... It all started
way back... such a long, long time back...
Way back in the days when the grass was still green and the pond was still wet and the clouds were still clean,
and the song of the Swomee-Swans rang out in space... one morning, I came to this glorious place. And I first
saw the trees! The Truffula Trees! The bright-colored tufts of the Truffula Trees! Mile after mile in the fresh
morning breeze.
And under the trees, I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits as the played in the
shade and ate Truffula Fruits. From the rippulous pond came the comfortable sound of the Humming-Fish
humming while splashing around.
But those trees! Those trees! Those Truffula Trees! All my life I'd been searching for trees such as these. The
touch of their tufts was much softer than silk. And they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk. 
2
I felt a great leaping of joy in my heart. I knew just what I'd do! I unloaded my cart. In no time at all, I had built
a small shop. Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop. And with great skillful skill and with great
speedy speed, I took the soft tuft. And I knitted a Thneed!
The instant I'd finished I heard a ga-Zump! I looked. I saw something pop out of the stump of the tree I'd
chopped down. It was sort of a man. Describe him...That's hard. I don't know if I can. He was shortish, and
oldish, and brownish and mossy. And he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy.
Mister! He said with a sawdusty sneeze, I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees, for the trees
have no tongues. And I'm asking you, sir, at the top of my lungs-- he was very upset as he shouted and puffed--
What's that THING you've made out of my Truffula tuft?
Look, Lorax, I said. There's no cause for alarm. I chopped just one tree. I am doing no harm. I'm being quite
useful. This thing is a Thneed. A Thneed's a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need! It’s a shirt. It's a sock. It's a
glove. It's a hat. But it has other uses. Yes, far beyond that. You can use it for carpets. For pillows! For sheets!
Or curtains! Or covers for bicycle seats! The Lorax said, Sir! You are crazy with greed. There is no one on earth
who would buy that fool Thneed!
But the very next minute I proved he was wrong. For, just at that minute, a chap came along, and he thought
that the Thneed I had knitted was great. He happily bought it for three ninety-eight. I laughed at the Lorax, You
poor stupid guy! You never can tell what some people will buy.
I repeat, cried the Lorax, I speak for the trees!
I'm busy, I told him. Shut up, if you please. I rushed 'cross the room, and in no time at all, built a radiophone. I
put in a quick call. I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts and I said, listen here! Here's a wonderful
chance for the whole Once-ler Family to get mighty rich! Get over here fast! Take the road to North Nitch. Turn
left at Weehawken. Sharp right at South Stitch.
And, in no time at all, in the factory I built, the whole Once-ler Family was working full tilt. We were all knitting
Thneed’s just as busy as bees, to the sound of the chopping of Truffula Trees.
Then... Oh! Baby! Oh! How my business did grow! Now, chopping one tree at a time was too slow. So I quickly
invented my Super-Axe-Hacker, which whacked off four Truffula Trees at one smacker. We were making
Thneed’s four times as fast as before! And that Lorax?... He didn't show up any more.
But the next week he knocked on my new office door. He snapped! I'm the Lorax who speaks for the trees,
which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please. But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots, who
played in the shade in their Bar-ba-loot suits and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits. NOW...thanks to your
hacking my trees to the ground, there's not enough Truffula Fruit to go 'round.
And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies!
They loved living here. But I can't let them stay. They'll have to find food. And I hope that they may. Good luck,
boys, he cried. And he sent them away.
I, the Once-ler, felt sad as I watched them all go. BUT... business is business! And business must grow
regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.
I meant no harm. I most truly did not. But I had to grow bigger. So bigger I got. I biggered my factory. I
biggered my roads. I biggered my wagons. I biggered the loads of the Thneed’s I shipped out. I was shipping
them forth to the South! To the East! To the West! To the North! I went right on biggering...selling more
Thneed’s. And I biggered my money, which everyone needs. 
3
Then again he came back! I was fixing some pipes when that old nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes. I
am the Lorax, he coughed and he whiffed. He sneezed and he snuffled. He snarggled. He sniffed. Once-ler! He
cried with a cruffulous croak. Once-ler! You're making such smogulous smoke!
My poor Swomee-Swans...why, they can't sing a note! No one can sing who has smog in his throat. And so, said
the Lorax, --please pardon my cough-- they cannot live here. So I'm sending them off. Where will they go? I
don't hopefully know. They may have to fly for a month...or a year... To escape from the smog you've smoggedup around here.
What's more, snapped the Lorax. (His dander was up.) Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp.
Your machinery chugs on, day and night without stop making Gluppity-Glupp. Also Schloppity-Schlopp. And
what do you do with this leftover goo? I'll show you. You dirty old Once-ler man, you!
You're glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish hummed! No more can they hum, for their gills are all
gummed. So I'm sending them off. Oh, their future is dreary. They'll walk on their fins and get woefully weary
in search of some water that isn't so smeary.
And then I got mad. I got terribly mad. I yelled at the Lorax, Now listen here, Dad! All you do is yap-yap and
say, Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Well, I have my rights, sir, and I'm telling you I intend to go on doing just what I do!
And, for your information, you Lorax, I'm figgering on biggering and Biggering and BIGGERING and
BIGGERING!! Turning MORE Truffula Trees into Thneed’s which everyone, EVERYONE, EVERYONE
needs!
And at that very moment, we heard a loud whack! From outside in the fields came a sickening smack of an axe
on a tree. Then we heard the tree fall. The very last Truffula Tree of them all! No more trees. No more Thneed’s.
No more work to be done. So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one, all waved my good-bye. They jumped
into my cars and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars.
Now all that was left beneath the bad-smelling sky was my big empty factory... the Lorax... and I.
The Lorax said nothing. Just gave me a glance... just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance... as he lifted
himself by the seat of his pants. And I'll never forget the grim look on his face when he hoisted himself and took
leave of this place, through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace. And all that the Lorax left here in this
mess was a small pile of rocks, with one word... UNLESS.
Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess.
That was long, long ago. But each day since that day I've sat here and worried and worried away. Through the
years, while my buildings have fallen apart, I've worried about it with all of my heart.
But now, says the Once-ler, Now that you're here, the word of the Lorax seems
perfectly clear. UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is
going to get better. It's not.
SO... Catch! Calls the Once-ler. He lets something fall. It's a Truffula Seed. It's the last one of all! You're in
charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds. And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs. Plant a new Truffula.
Treat it with care. Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air. Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack. Then
the Lorax and all of his friends may come back

SO I WILL EAT THEM IN A BOX.
AND I WILL EAT THEM WITH A FOX.
AND I WILL EAT THEM IN A HOUSE.
AND I WILL EAT THEM WITH A MOUSE.
AND I WILL EAT THEM HERE AND THERE.
SAY! I WILL EAT THEM ANYWHERE!
I DO SO LIKE GREEN EGGS AND HAM!
THANK YOU! THANK YOU, SAM I AM.


"It’s a pretty good zoo,"
Said young Gerald McGrew, 
"And the fellow who runs it 
Seems proud of it too. 
But if I ran the zoo,"
Said young Gerald McGrew, "I’d make a few changes. That’s just what I’d do. 
The lions and tigers and that kind of stuff 
They have up here now are not quite good enough. You see things like these in any old zoo. 
They’re awfully old­fashioned. I want something new! 
So I’d open each cage, I’ll unlock every pen, Let the animals go and start over again. 
And somehow or other I think I could find 
Some beasts of some beasts of a more unusual kind. 
A four­footed lion’s not much of a beast. The one in my zoo will have 10 feet at least. 
Five legs on the left and five more on the right. 
Then people will stare, and they’ll say, 
'What a sight!' My New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, will make people talk. 
My new zoo, McGrew zoo, will make people gawk. 
They’ll be so surprised, they’ll swallow their gum. 
They’ll ask when they see my strange animals come,
'Where do you suppose he gets things like that from?'
If you want to catch beasts you don’t see every day,
You have to go places quite out of the way.
You have to go places no others can get to.
You have to get cold and you have to get wet too. 
I’ll catch 'em in caves, I’ll catch 'em in brooks, 
I’ll catch 'em in crannies, I’ll catch 'em in nooks 
That you don’t read about in geography books. 
I’ll load up five boats with a family of Joats 
Whose feet are like cows, but wear squirrel­skin coats, 
And sit like dogs, but have voices like goats— 
Excepting they can’t sing the very high notes. 
And then I’ll go down to the Wilds of Nantucket, 
And capture a family of Lunks in a bucket. 
Then people will say, 'Now I like that boy heaps. 
His New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, is growing by leaps. 
He captures them wild, he captures them meek, 
He captures them slim, he captures them sleek.
What do you suppose he will capture next week?'
In the far western part 
In southeast North Dakota Lives a very fine animal called the Iota. 
But I’ll capture one 
Who is even much finer 
In the northeastern west part of South Carolina. 
When people see him they will say, 
'Now by thunder! This New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, is really a wonder!'
I’ll bag a big bug Who is very surprising, 
A feller who has A propeller for rising 
And zooming around making cross­country hops, 
From Texas to Boston with only two stops. 
Now that kind of thing for a bug is just tops! 
In a cave in Kartoom is a beast called a Natch 
That no other hunter’s been able to catch. 
He’s hidden for years in his cave with a pout 
And no one’s been able to make him come out. 
But I’ll coax him out with a wonderful meal 
That’s cooked by my cooks in my cooker mobile. 
They’ll fix up a dish that is just to his taste; 
Three chicken croquettes made of library paste. 
Then sprinkled with peanut shucks, pickled and spiced, 
Then baked at 600 degrees and then iced. 
It’s mighty hard cooking to cook up such feasts 
But that’s how the New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, gets beasts. 
'He hunts with such vims, he hunts with such vigor. 
His new zoo, McGrew’s Zoo, gets bigger and bigger.'
Then the whole town will gasp, ‘Why this boy never sleeps! 
No keeper before ever kept what he keeps. 
There’s no telling what that young fellow will do!’ 
And then, just to show them, I’ll sail to Ka­troo 
And bring back an It­Kutch a Preep and a Proo, 
A Nerkle, a Nerd and a Seersucker too. 
'This Zookeeper, New keeper’s simply astounding.
He travels so far that you think he’d drop! 
When do you suppose this young fellow will stop?'
Stop… ? Well, I should. 
But I won’t stop until I’ve captures the Fizza­ma­Wizza­ma­Dill, 
The world's biggest bird from the Island of Gwark 
Who only eats pine trees and spits out the bark. 
And boy! When I get him back home to my park, 
The whole world will say, 
'Young McGrew’s made his mark.'

On the last day of summer, ten hours before Fall…

my grandfather took me out to the wall.
 
For a while he stood silent. Then finally he said, with a very sad shake of his very old head, “As you know, on this side of the Wall we are Yooks.  On the far other side of this Wall live the Zooks.” 

Then my grandfather said, “It’s high time that you knew of the terribly horrible thing that Zooks do.  In every Zook house and in every Zook town every Zook eats his bread with the butter side down!” 

“But we Yooks, as you know, when we breakfast or sup, spread our bread,”  Grandpa said, “with the butter side up.  That’s the right, honest way!”  Grandpa gritted his teeth. “So you can’t trust a Zook who spreads bread underneath! Every Zook must be watched! He has kinks in his soul!  That’s why, as a youth, I made watching my goal, watching Zooks for the Zook-Watching Border Patrol!

In those day, of course, the Wall wasn’t so high and I could look any Zook square in the eye. 

If he dared to come close I could give him a twitch with my tough tufted prickely Snick-Berry Switch.

For a while that worked fine.  All the Zooks stayed away and our country was safe.  Then one terrible day a very rude Zook by the name of VanItch snuck up and slingshotted my Snick-Berry Switch!

With my broken- off switch, with my head hung in shame, to the Chief lookeroo in great sorrow I came.  But our leader just smiled.  He said, “ You’re not to blame.  And those Zooks will be sorry they started this game. 

“We’ll dress you right up in a fancier suit!  We’ll give you a fancier slingshot to shoot!”  And he ordered the Boys in the Back Room to figger how to build me some sort of triple-sling jigger. 

With my Triple-Sling Jigger I sure felt much bigger. 

I marched to the Wall with great vim and great vigor, right up to VanItch with my hand on the trigger.  “I’ll have no more nonsense,”  I said with a frown, “from Zooks who eat bread with the butter side down!” 

VanItch looked quite sickly.  He ran off quite Quickly. 

I’m unhappy to say he came back the next day in a spiffy new suit with a big new machine, and he snarled as he said, looking frightfully mean, “You may fling those hard rocks with your Triple-Sling Jigger.  But I, also, now have my hand on a trigger! 

“My wonderful weapon, the Jigger-Rock Snatchem, will fling ‘em right back just as quick as we catch ‘em.  We’ll have no more nonsense.  We’ll take no more gupp from you Yooks who eat bread with th butter side up!”

“I have failed, sir,”  I sobbed as I made my report to the Chief Yookeroo in the headquarters fort.  He just laughed. “You’ve done nothing at all of the sort.  Our slingshots have failed.  That was old-fashioned stuff.  Slingshots, dear boy, are not modern enough. 

“All we need is some newfangled kind of gun.  My Boys in the Back Room have already begun to think up a walloping whiz-zinger one!  My Bright Boys are thinking.  They’re on the right track.  They’ll think one up quick and we’ll send you right back!” 

They thought up a great one!  They certainly did.  They thought up a gun called the Kick-a-Doo Powder and ant’s eggs and bees’ legs and dried-fried clam chowder.  And they carefully trained a real smart dog named Daniel to serve as our country’s first gun-toting spaniel. 

Then Daniel, the Kick-a-Poo Spaniel, and I marched back toward the Wall with our heads held up gigh while everyone cheered and their cheers filled the sky; “Fight! Fight for the Butter Side Up! Do or die!” 

Well…

We didn’t do.  And we didn’t quite die.  But we sure did get worsted, poor Daniel and I.  VanItch was there too! And he said, the old pig, “The Boys as in my Back Room invented this rig called the Eight-Nozzled, Elephant-Toted Boom-Blitz.  It shoots high-explosive sour cherry stone pits and will put your dumb Kick-a-Poo Kid on the fritz!”  Poor Daniel and I were scared out of our witz! 

Once more, by VanItch I was bested and beat.  Once again I limped home from the Wall in defeat.  I dragged and I sagged and my spirits were low, as low as I thought that they ever could go, when I heard a Boom-Bah! And a Diddle-dee-Dill!  And our Butter-Up Band marched up over the Hill! 

The Chief Yookeroo had sent them to meet me along with the Right-Side-Up Song Girls to greet me.  They sang:  “Oh, be faithful! Believe in thy butter!”  And they lifted my spirits right out of the gutter! 

“My boy”, smiled the Chief Yookeroo, “we’ve just voted and made you a general! You’ve been promoted.  Your pretty new uniform’s ready.  Get in it! The Big War is coming.  You’re going to begin it!  And what’s more, this time you are certain to win it. 

“My Boys in the Back Room have finally found how.  Just wait till you see what they’ve puttered up now!  In their great new machine you’ll fly over that Wall and clobber those Butter-Down Zooks one and all!” 

Those Boys in the Back Room sure knew how to putter! They made me a thing called the Utterly Sputter and I jumped aboard with my heart all aflutter and steered toward the land of the Upside-Down Butter. 

This machine was so modern, so frightfully new, no one knew quite exactly just what it would do! 

But it had several faucets that sprinkled Blue Goo which, somehow, would sprinkle the Zooks as I flew and gum up that upside-down butter they chew. 

I was racing pell-mell when I heard a voice yell, “If you sprinkle us Zooks, you’ll get sprinkled as well!” 

VanItch had a Sputter exactly like mine!  And he yelled, “My Blue-Gooer is working just fine!  And I’m here to say that if Yooks can goo Zooks, you’d better forget it. ‘Cause Zooks can goo Yooks!”

I flew right back home and, as you may have guessed, I was downright despondent, disturbed, and depressed.  And I saw, just as soon as I stepped back on land, so were all of the girls of the Butter-Up Band. 

The Chief Drum Majorette, Miz Yookie-Ann Sue, said, “That was a pretty sour flight that you flew.  And the Chief Yookeroo has been looking for you!”

I raced to his office.  The place was a sight.  “Have no fears,” said the Chief.  “Everything is all right.  My Bright Back Room Boys have been brighter than bright.  They’ve thought up a gadget that’s Newer than New.  It is filled with mysterious Moo-Lacka-Moo and can blow all those Zooks clear to Sala-ma-goo.  THEY’VE INVENTED THE BITSY BIG-BOY BOOMEROO! 

“You just run to the wall like a nice little man.  Drop this bomb on the Zooks just as fast as you can.  I have ordered all Yooks to stay safe underground while the Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo is around.” 

As I raced for that Wall, with the bomb in my hand, I noticed that every last Yook in our land was obeying our Chief Yookeroo’s grim command. 

They were all bravely marching, with banners aflutter, down a hole! For their country!  And Right-Side-Up Butter!

 That’s when Grandfather found me!  He grabbed me.  He said, “You should be down that hole!  And you’re up here instead!  But perhaps this is all for the better, somehow.  You will see me make history! RIGHT HERE! AND RIGHT NOW!

Grandpa leapt up that Wall with a lopulous leap and he clearedhis harse throat with a bopulous beep.  He screamed, “Here’s the end of that terrible town full of Zooks who eat bread with the butter side down!” 

And at the very instant we heard a klupp-klupp of feet on the Wall and old VanItch klupped up! The Boys in HIS Back Room had made him one too!  In his fist was another Big-Boy Boomeroo!  “I’ll blow you,” he yelled, “into pork and wee beans! I’ll butter-side-up you to small smithereens!”

“Grandpa!”  I shouted.  “Be careful! Oh, gee! Who’s going to drop it?  Will you…? Or will he…?

“Be patient,” said Grandpa. “We’ll see. We will see…”


I can read in red.
I can read in blue.
I can read in pickle-color too.

I can read in bed.
And in purple.
And in brown.
I can read in a circle and upside-down!

I can read with my left eye.
I can read with my right.
I can read Mississippi with my eyes shut tight!

Mississippi,
Indianapolis,
and
Hallelujah,
too!
I can read them
with my eyes shut!
That is
VERY HARD
to do!

But it's bad
for my hat
and makes
my eyebrows
get red hot.
SO...
reading with
my eyes shut
I don't do an awful lot.

And when I keep them open
I can read with much more speed.
You have to be a speedy reader
'cause there's so, so much to read!

You can read about trees...
and bees...
and knees.
And knees on trees!
And bees on threes!

You can read about anchors.
And all about ants.
You can read
about ankles!
And crocodile pants!

You can read about hoses...
and how to smell roses...
and what
you should do
about owls on noses!

Young cat! If you keep
your eyes open enough,
oh, the stuff you will learn!
The most wonderful stuff!
You'll learn about...
fishbones...
and wishbones.
You'll learn
about trombones,
too.
You'll learn
about Jake
the Pillow Snake
and all about
Foo-Foo the Snoo.

You can learn about ice.
You can learn about mice.
Mice on ice.
And ice on mice.
You can learn about
the price of ice.
Nice ice
for sale.
Ten cents a pail.

You can learn about SAD...
and GLAD...
and MAD!
There are 
so many things
you can learn about.
BUT...
you'll miss
the best things
if you keep
your eyes shut.

The more that you read,
the more things you will know.
The more that you learn,
the more places you'll go.

You might learn
a way to earn
a few dollars.
Or how to make doughnuts...
or kangaroo collars.

You can learn to read music
and play a Hut-Zut
if you keep your eyes open.
But not with them shut.

If you read with your eyes shut
you're likely to find
that the place where you're going
is far, far behind

SO...
that's why I tell you
to keep your eyes wide.
Keep them wide open...
at least on one side.



THE SNEETCHES
by Dr Seuss
Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches
Had bellies with stars.
The Plain-Belly Sneetches
Had none upon thars.
Those stars weren't so big. They were really so small
You might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all.
But, because they had stars, all the Star-Belly Sneetches
Would brag, "We're the best kind of Sneetch on the beaches."
With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they'd snort
“We'll have nothing to do with the Plain-Belly sort!"
And whenever they met some, when they were out walking,
They'd hike right on past them without even talking.
When the Star-Belly children went out to play ball,
Could a Plain-Belly get in the game...? Not at all.
You could only play if your bellies had stars
And the Plain-Belly children had none upon thars.
When the Star-Belly Sneetches had frankfurter roasts
Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,
They never invited the Plain-Belly Sneetches.
They left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.
They kept them away. Never let them come near.
And that's how they treated them year after year.

Then ONE day, it seems...while the Plain-Belly Sneetches
Were moping and doping alone on the beaches,
Just sitting there wishing their bellies had stars...
A stranger zipped up in the strangest of cars!

"My friends," he announced in a voice clear and keen,
"My name is Sylvester McMonkey McBean.
And I've heard of your troubles. I've heard you're unhappy.
But I can fix that. I'm the Fix-it-Up Chappie.
I've come here to help you. I have what you need.
And my prices are low. And I work at great speed.
And my work is one hundred per cent guaranteed!"
Then, quickly, Sylvester McMonkey McBean
Put together a very peculiar machine.
And he said, "You want stars like a Star-Belly Sneetch...?
My friends, you can have them for three dollars each!” 
“Just pay me your money and hop right aboard!"
So they clambered inside. Then the big machine roared
And it clonked. And it bonked. And it jerked. And it berked
And it bopped them about. But the thing really worked!
When the Plain-Belly Sneetches popped out, they had stars!
They actually did. They had stars upon thars!
Then they yelled at the ones who had stars from the start,
"We're exactly like you! You can't tell us apart.
We're all just the same, now, you snooty old smarties!
And now we can go to your frankfurter parties."
"Good grief!" groaned the ones who had stars at the first.
"We're still the best Sneetches and they are the worst.
But, now, how in the world will we know," they all frowned,
"If which kind is what, or the other way round?"
Then up came McBean with a very sly wink
And he said, "Things are not quite as bad as you think.
So you don't know who's who. That’s perfectly true.
But come with me, friends. Do you know what I'll do?
I'll make you, again, the best Sneetches on beaches
And all it will cost you is ten dollars eaches.”
Belly stars are no longer in style," said McBean.
"What you need is a trip through my Star-Off machine.
This wondrous contraption will take off your stars
So you won't look like Sneetches who have them on thars."
And that handy machine
Working very precisely
Removed all the stars from their tummies quite nicely.
Then, with snoots in the air, they paraded about
And they opened their beaks and they let out a shout,
"We know who is who! Now there isn't a doubt.
The best kind of Sneetches are Sneetches without!"
Then, of course, those with stars all got frightfully mad.
To be wearing a star now was frightfully bad.
Then, of course, old Sylvester McMonkey McBean
Invited them into his Star-Off Machine.
Then, of course from then on, as you probably guess,
Things really got into a horrible mess.
All the rest of that day, on those wild screaming beaches,
The Fix-it-Up Chappie kept fixing up Sneetches.
Off again! On again! 
In again! Out again!
Through the machines they raced round and about again,
Changing their stars every minute or two.
They kept paying money. They kept running through
Until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew
Whether this one was that one...or that one was this one
Or which one was what one...or what one was who.
Then, when every last cent
Of their money was spent,
The Fix-it-Up Chappie packed up
And he went.

And he laughed as he drove
In his car up the beach,
"They never will learn.
No. You can't teach a Sneetch!"
But McBean was quite wrong. I'm quite happy to say
The Sneetches got really quite smart on that day,
The day they decided that Sneetches are Sneetches
And no kind of Sneetch is the best on the beaches.
That day, all the Sneetches forgot about stars
And whether they had one, or not, upon thars.
The end.
